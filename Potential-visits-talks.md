This page is for tracking contact data and ideas for external speakers to visit the Hackspace and talk to us about what they do, or alternately for a group of Hackspace members to visit them on site and see what they do.

Unless otherwise noted, no contact with the listed companies has been made yet, its just a list! Actual planned talks/visits should be entered on the [[Hackspace Events]] page.
