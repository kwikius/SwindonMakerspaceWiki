The thicknesser/planer requires induction. Speak to Damian Axford or Joe Earlam.

The thicknesser side is used to plane wood down to a specific thickness with parallel faces. The planer side is used to plane wood to a flat surface referenced to a perpendicular edge (the fence). It is useful for cleaning up reclaimed wood (pallets etc), and making warped wood straighter.

The thicknesser/planer requires sawdust extraction using the mobile unit (blue barrel with long hose). It produces enormous amounts of wood chips, so the extraction unit should be checked every five to ten minutes of operation to ensure it does not back up. A backed up unit requires the entire hose unblocking and is a tedious process.
