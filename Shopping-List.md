This page is to gather a list of items that we want to buy for the hackspace.  Items can either be new tools that we'd like or replenishment of consumables we've run out of.  Feel free to add stuff as you see fit.

When you add something to this page please try to include the price and a recommendation where to get it from, be that a real shop or a link to a website.

The plan is that this page should be reviewed regularly and an agreement reached as to what should be bought and where from by Rob, Damian, James, Jamie, Jess and Steve.  One of them will order the items and claim the money back from the Hackspace account via Rob. (That doesn't mean these are the only people who can suggest stuff!)

### Immediately Required
These items are definitely required now and should be bought as soon as possible.

Items | Notes / Supplier / Website | Price
:--- | :---------- | :------ | :--------
Small diameter heatshrink | todo: confirm diameter
Drill bits | todo: confirm sizes required or if anyone a has any spare at home.
Stripboard | todo: amount for LED arrays (Arduino workshop?), and general use.
Jumper leads | RL: checked last night, appear to be quite a few of various genders in the electronics box, so I don't think we need these

### Wish List / Suggestions
These items are things that it might be nice to have available and should be discussed and prioritised.

It makes sense to go through these lists and bundle together smaller wanted items whenever making a more urgent purchase (to minimise deliveries, for cost and inconvenience).
