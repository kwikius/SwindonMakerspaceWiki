The table saw requires induction. See Inductors list

The table saw is used for long, straight cuts to wood and plastic. It may be capable of cutting thin aluminium, but this has not been tried yet. It requires dust extraction using the portable dust extraction unit (blue barrel with long hose attached).

Safety
======

Safety glasses and hearing protection are required for this machine. Long hair should be tied back and sleeves rolled up as they may catch in the blade.

Attach the dust extraction machine (scheppach) to the T pipe on the back. There ahould be a tube from it to a guard over the main blade.

Do not lean over blade when running.

Do not push work piece near blade with hands, use a stick.

Use
===

Move the machine so that you have room to catch your enture piev=ce of wood off the back of the machine. If its a large board do not operate alone.

Adjust the cut width by unlocking the lever on the right hand side, moving the fence using the dial on the front (not by hand!), and relocking the lever.

Use the large wheel on the front to change the blade height to be just taller than the wood to cut (a tooth showing).

If required the whole table can be angled by unlocking the lever behind the wheel  and pushing the table, relock when done.

Make sure you have a pusher stick to push your workpiece past the blade.

Push your entire work piece past the blade, so that it is no longer touching the blade, before turning off.

Do not stand in front of the machine with loose pieces of wood right of the blade, as the spinning blade may fire them into you.
