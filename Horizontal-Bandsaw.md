The horizontal bandsaw requires induction.

The horizontal bandsaw is a large, floor mounted saw, used for cutting large pieces of metal - large being anything bigger than around 10mm in diameter, where cutting with a hacksaw would take exceptionally long amounts of time. The largest material size is around 175x300x300mm, although larger pieces will require time to let the motor stop and cool down. It can also cut plastic, and due to the slow saw speed will not melt the cut like the mitre saw.

The saw has been converted from three phase operation to single phase by re-wiring the control board and interlocks to work with a single phase power supply, and using a metal film capacitor bank as a phase delay to simulate a third phase. Due to the imperfect nature of the capacitor method of running a three phase motor from one phase, the motor temperature should be monitored by hand. If too hot to touch it should be left to cool before continuing the cutting operation - this may take some time. Donations of a suitable (1500rpm, 750W, 240V) single phase motor would be greatly appreciated.

# Usage

This does not replace an induction! Please speak to a member of the metalwork team for induction.

* Wheel bandsaw from its home against the wall. Give yourself plenty of room to insert your stock, retrieve it afterwards, and operate the controls.
* Uncoil cable and plug in - keep it away from any moving parts and your working area.
* Lift the arm to the height required to insert your stock, and flip the lockout lever down so that it stays in position.
* Spin the handle twice anticlockwise and the clamp jaw will be free to move. Insert your stock, make sure it's flat, straight and level. Bar stock should be positioned with the flat side on the bed, so that the stock touches as many teeth as possible while cutting. L/right angle section stock should be positioned angle upwards for the same reason.

* Push the jaw against it before tightening. Make sure it's clamped securely, especially if the stock is round or right angled as it can rotate during cutting.
* If cutting at an angle, you will need to loosen the tall bolt on the moving jaw, and both bolts on the fixed side by 1-2 turns. Use the guide on the back side of the bed to set the angle, slide the moving jaw against the fixed one, and tighten the bolts again - do not overtighten!
* Turn the drop speed dial all the way anticlockwise and use the lockout lever to bring the blade down to just above the stock - you may have to reposition it for the correct cutting position.
* Turn the drop speed dial all the way clockwise, then back anticlockwise **a maximum of half a turn**.
* Use the green start button to start the saw, and flip the lockout lever up. It will slowly descend.
* Use cutting oil or WD40 to lubricate the cut. You will need to reapply every 30s or so throughout the cut, especially for large pieces.
* If doing large or frequent cuts, keep an eye on the motor temperature - if the case is uncomfortable to touch, you will need to let the machine cool down.
* Once your cut is finished, the machine will stop itself (this may take a few seconds as the interlock is a few millimetres below the cut depth). You can also use the red stop button to stop the motor.
* Lift the arm, flip the lockout lever down, and remove your stock from the clamp jaws.
* Clean the bed with a brush if required.
* Re-set the clamp jaws to 90 degrees if required, and lower the arm by turning the drop speed dial anticlockwise and opening the lockout lever.
* Remove the cable and plug, and coil on top of the motor, away from the wheels.
* Push the bandsaw back against the wall out of the way.
