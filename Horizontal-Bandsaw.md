The horizontal bandsaw requires induction.

The horizontal bandsaw is a large, floor mounted saw, used for cutting large pieces of metal - large being anything bigger than around 10mm in diameter, where cutting with a hacksaw would take exceptionally long amounts of time. The largest material size is around 175x300x300mm, although larger pieces will require time to let the motor stop and cool down. It can also cut plastic, and due to the slow saw speed will not melt the cut like the mitre saw.

The saw has been converted from three phase operation to single phase by re-wiring the control board and interlocks to work with a single phase power supply, and using a metal film capacitor bank as a phase delay to simulate a third phase. Due to the imperfect nature of the capacitor method of running a three phase motor from one phase, the motor temperature should be monitored by hand. If too hot to touch it should be left to cool before continuing the cutting operation - this may take some time. Donations of a suitable (1500rpm, 750W, 240V) single phase motor would be greatly appreciated.
