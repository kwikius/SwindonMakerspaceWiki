## Introduction

This page summarises a series of instructor-lead workshops to introduce people to modelling with OpenSCAD, primarily as a precursor 3D printing.   The workshops are developed/lead by members of the Swindon Hackspace.

## Course Outline

1. Intro to OpenSCAD - language basics, exporting to STL
2. Advanced functions and Common libraries (utils and vitamins) - an overview of the most useful libraries out there
3. Multi-part models - coding best practise, modularity, using "attach", animations
4. Machine design - concepts, file structure, bulk generating STL, generating BOMs
5. Collaborative design (using github/dropbox) - best practises, hint&tips


## Interested People
1. Rob - for the move advanced stuff (2 onwards)

## Lesson Plan

### 1. Intro to OpenSCAD

**Goal:** Design a basic part and export it as an STL file for printing

* Interface
* 2D Shapes - Circle, Square
* Translation
* Rotation
* Extrusion - linear_extrude
* Booleans - Union, Difference, Intersection
* Hull
* Loops - For
* 3D Shapes - Sphere, Cube, Cylinder
* Modules
* Layout and coding best practises
* Finish your part
* Export as STL
