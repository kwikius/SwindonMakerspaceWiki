### Changing filament

To change the filament:
- first either use the buttons on Octoprint, or the UI on the printer screen, to preheat the extruder hotend enough to melt the plastic - 200 degrees should be enough for PLA.
- second use the "unload filament" option on the printer screen, pull gently to remove the filament completely
- replace the filament spool on the holder and locate the end
- feed the end into the top of the extruder, shove gently while using the "load filament" option on the printer screen; answer "no" until the colour changes coming out of the extruder.
- use pliers or similar to remove the excess filament dribble
