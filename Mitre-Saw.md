The mitre saw requires induction. Speak to Joe Earlam for induction.

The mitre saw is used to make angled (including plain 90 degree) cuts in wood. It can also be used for plastic, although the blade speed is high and can melt the material ends. The vertical bandsaw is likely better for use with plastic.

The horizontal angle can be changed by pushing the saw down and loosening the thumbscrew on the front, then twisting the saw until the desired angle is reached. The vertical angle is changed by loosening the knob on the rear and tilting it left until the desired angle is reached. 

The mitre saw produces large amounts of sawdust from the rear, and should be moved to a clear workbench near the middle of the room to ease cleaning.
