The sliding mitre saw requires induction. See Inductors list.

The mitre saw is used to make angled (including plain 90 degree) cuts in wood. It can also be used for plastic, although the blade speed is high and can melt the material ends. The vertical bandsaw is likely better for use with plastic.

The mitre is bolted to the bench, do not move it without permission.
