The mitre saw is typically used for cutting wood to lentgh, typically referred to as cross cutting. It is best used with dust extraction using the portable dust extractor.

This is a compound saw which means apart from plain 90 degree cuts it can make angled cuts in the horizontal plane (up to 60 degrees L & R) known as mitre cut and in the vertical plane (up to 48 degrees L & R) known as bevel cuts. When cuts are made in both planes at the same time time it is a compound cut.

The mitre saw is bolted to the bench and is not to be moved. 

# Safety

Safety glasses and hearing protection are highly recommended for use with this machine. Long hair should be tied back, loose clothing and jewellery should be rolled up / removed as they may catch.

Do not lean over blade when it is running or stand directly behind blade when cutting as if “kick back” occurs workpiece can strike you.

Avoid cutting very short pieces, manufacturer reccomends keeping hands at least 100mm from blade. Clamp small pieces rather than hand hold.
 
**In the event of a problem with the machine report it on telegram and if it’s a safety issue clearly mark the machine " Do Not Use"**

To cut work pieces narrower than the blade, lock the slide using the small tensioned lock on the slide at the left rear, to cut wider items, unlock the tensioned.

Clamp workpiece to the bed using the clamps, ensuring that the blade assembly/carriage will not hit the clamp head on the way down.

The red laser line will show where the blade will cut. Test by lowering the blade assembly first with the power off, until the blade reaches your workpiece.

To cut, pull the blade assembly forward (if cutting large items), hold in the small button on the handle, pull the handle+power lever down, allow machine to run up to speed (it has a "soft start") lower into workpiece and push back to cut, return the blade assembly upright before letting go.

Return to default
Ensure the bed/cutting angle is 90 degrees, and the blade assembly angle is 90 degrees.

Lock the slide.

Use the extractor to hoover up your wood shavings, particularly from the area under the blade.
