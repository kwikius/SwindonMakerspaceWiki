To identify an inductor go to/join Inductions chat group on Telegram and use command "/inducted_on Mitre Saw"

The mitre saw is typically used for cutting wood to lentgh, typically referred to as cross cutting. It is best used with dust extraction using the portable dust extractor.

This is a compound saw which means apart from plain 90 degree cuts it can make angled cuts in the horizontal plane (up to 60 degrees L & R) known as mitre cut and in the vertical plane (up to 48 degrees L & R) known as bevel cuts. When cuts are made in both planes at the same time time it is a compound cut.

The mitre saw is bolted to the bench and is not to be moved. 

# Safety

Safety glasses and hearing protection are highly recommended for use with this machine. Long hair should be tied back, loose clothing and jewellery should be rolled up / removed as they may catch.

Do not lean over blade when it is running or stand directly behind blade when cutting as if ‚Äúkick back‚Äù occurs workpiece can strike you.

Avoid cutting very short pieces, manufacturer reccomends keeping hands at least 100mm from blade. Clamp small pieces rather than hand hold.
 
**In the event of a problem with the machine report it on telegram and if it‚Äôs a safety issue clearly mark the machine " Do Not Use"**

# Use 
**90 degree cuts**
Always ensure workpiece is firmly held and aligned with fence, preferably hold workpiece down to the bed using the clamp, ensuring that the blade assembly/carriage will not hit the clamp head on the way down.

To cut work pieces narrower than the blade, lock the slide using the small tensioned lock on the slide at the left rear, to cut wider items unlock.

If switched on the red laser line will show where the blade will cut. Test by lowering the blade assembly first with the trigger off, until the blade reaches your workpiece.

Push the saw through the workpiece. **Never pull the saw through the workpiece**. To make a cut, raise the saw head and pull it out over
the workpiece without cutting, start the motor, press the saw head down and push the saw through the workpiece, return the blade assembly upright before letting go.

**Mitre cuts.** Set the required angle (L or R) by releasing the front grip and depressing lock lever for the turn base and swing carriage. There are positive stops at 0¬∞, 15¬∞, 22.5¬∞, 31.6¬∞, 45¬∞, and 60¬∞ right/left to set miter angle quickly. (31.6 is for certain Crown Moulding compound cuts). Lock the turn base and proceed as with 90 degree cuts.

**Bevel Cuts** The high fence extensions** MUST **be removed to use bevel function.

**For L side bevels**, release knob on upper slide pole, depress latch lever on bevel scale (see photo). Tilt carriage to required angle and tighten release knob. Note there are positive stops at 22.5, 33.9 (for coving, crown moulding) and 45 degress. Lock the turn base knob and proceed as with 90 degree cuts.

**For R side bevels**, release knob on upper slide pole, depress latch lever on bevel scale (see photo) tilt slightly left and depress button on LH side then tilt right to desired angle. Lock the turn base knob and proceed as with 90 degree cuts.

Saw allows for Bevel cuts up to 48 degress, to acheive this, in addition to the instructions above you need to use the release lever as illustrated in the photo below.

# When Finished work return saw to default state and clean up

Unplug/Switch power off at wall and disconnect dust extractor and coil hose.

If you have made bevel cuts return carriage to 90 degress for next user.

Lock the slide.

Ensure the bed/cutting angle is 90 degrees, and the blade assembly angle is 90 degrees.

Use the extractor to hoover up your wood shavings, particularly from the area under the blade.

Brush off any sawdust on saw and bench its mounted on. Check If there are any small pieces of wood not picked up by extractor in saw well. 

**Workshop Cleanliness**
Put any hand tools used back in the rack.

Brush down any machines you have used and store appropriately. Sweep workshop floor ‚Äì doesn‚Äôt need to be spotless but clean and tidy ‚Äì a good aim is cleaner than you found it üòä

Check if dust extractor needs emptying, if so empty into a black bin bag, stocks found under kitchen sink, or workshop bin if room. Please take full bags/bins to the skip or one of the other bins on Biz Space site.
