The mitre saw is typically used for cutting wood to lentgh, typically referred to as cross cutting, and hard plastics (with care). It is best used with dust extraction using the portable dust extractor.

The mitre saw is used to make angled (including plain 90 degree) cuts in wood. It can also be used for plastic, although the blade speed is high and can melt the material ends. The vertical bandsaw is likely better for use with plastic.

The mitre saw is bolted to the bench, do not move it without permission.

Safety
Safety glasses and hearing protection should be worn.

Long hair should be tied back and loose sleeves rolled up.

Use
Angle of bed can be adjusted by unscewing large red knob at front of machine, squeezing red lever and pushing sideways. There are some preset angles the lever will slot into. Retighten knob to lock in angle.

Blade angle can be adjusted by lossening large red knob at back of machine, and pulling entire blade assembly to the side. Retitghten knob afterwards.

To cut work pieces smaller than the blade, lock the slide using the small tensioned lock on the slide at the bck.

To cut larger items, unlock the tensioned lock on the slde.

Clamp workpiece to the bed using the clamps, ensure that the blade assembly will not hit the clamp head on the way down.

The red laser line will show where the blade will cut. Test by lowering the blade assembly first with the power off, until the blade reaches your workpiece.

To cut, pull the blade assembly forward (if cutting large items), hold in the small red button on the handle, pull the handle+power lever down, and push back to cut, return the blade assembly upright before letting go.

Return to default
Ensure the bed/cutting angle is 90 degrees, and the blade assembly angle is 90 degrees.

Lock the slide.

Use the extractor to hoover up your wood shavings, particularly from the area under the blade.
