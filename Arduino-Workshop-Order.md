## Materials Needed

* Arduino and breadboard kits (tbc)
* Jumper wires, LEDs, resistors, switches, potentiometers

## Items

Some items currently researching to satisfy kits needed for [[Arduino Workshop]].

Note: All items listed have a long delivery time (2-3 weeks).

Main choice is to go with a larger (but less cute) breadboard, and how many packs of jumpers to split among the kits (65pcs / 3 Kits?).
