## Materials Needed

* Arduino and breadboard kits (tbc)
* Jumper wires, LEDs, resistors, switches, potentiometers

## Items

Some items currently researching to satisfy kits needed for [[Arduino Workshop]].

Note: All items listed have a long delivery time (2-3 weeks).

Main choice is the controller: if going with a arduino compatible Pro Mini, a USB to Serial lead is required - otherwise the more expensive Pro Micro requires a standard USB micro cable. If the cost works out about the same, then the Micro is the better device for general use.
