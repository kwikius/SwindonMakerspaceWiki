## Materials Needed

* Computer running Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux.

Please bring a laptop if you have one - let us know if you need a PC set up on the night.

We'll be covering the above configuration only - other devices or operating systems are welcome, so long as you can install git ahead of time and have working LAN or WiFi hardware.

All the software used will be Raspberry Pi friendly; so if you have a portable screen, HDMI to VGA cable, or you are already set up to use a remote or serial connection, then you can use your Pi.
