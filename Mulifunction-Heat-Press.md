### Operating

WARNING the various heating plates get very hot use extream care when operating and make sure the device is off before leaving.

The main heating plate and the mug plate have two cables which connect to the main control unit, the 4 pin cable supplies the heating element and controls the temperature, the two pin cable is for the microswitch, this is what activates the timer when the plate is compressed.

The Cap plate and the Plates plates do not have a microswitch so only have the 4 pin cable to connect.

Make sure the main control unit is switched off before connecting the cables, each cable plug has a different number of connectors and can only be connected to its corresponding socket.

The top display of the control unit displays the temperature of the plate being used and the bottom display show the time that has been set.

When you first switch the device on it will show the setting from the last time it was used.

### Set the controller as follows

Press the Set button - SP will appear in the top display, use the arrow buttons to increase and decrease the temperature seen in the bottom display to the required temp.

Press the set button - St will appear in the top display, use the arrow buttons to set the time required in seconds.

Press the set button - the top display will show  C - F, use the arrows to select Celcius or Faranhight.

Press the set button - the displays now show the temperature at the top and time on the bottom you have set
(Note: if you have just switched on the machine then the plate will not have reached the required temperature and you will see the displayed temperature increase on the display until it reaches the set temperature.)


*** Advance Settings

The advanced setting allows the plate to start at a pre-set temperature and then increase the temperature to a higher level when the plate is compressed when this higher level is reached the timer will start and after the pre-set time stop and sound the alarm.

This is required when printing onto mugs and plates as the cold mug or plate will initially reduce the temperature and needs time to reach the operating temperature.
