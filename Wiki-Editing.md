### Useful links for wiki editors

- Index of [all the wiki pages](_pages).

- Notes on [[Using Social Media]]

- Wiki for [gollum, the git-based wiki engine][gollum]

  The main reason to visit the gollum wiki is to see how to [easily link][gollum] to `[[other pages]]`.

  Not many of the remaining gollum syntax/features seem to be supported by github's wikis.

  `tl;dr: just the link format seems to work.`
