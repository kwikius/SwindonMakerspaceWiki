The vertical bandsaw requires induction. 

The vertical bandsaw is a small bench mounted unit, and useful for cutting wood, plastic and aluminium. The fence is substandard, and requires checking with a square when set.

Do not touch any adjustments other than the fence and blade guide height. Adjusting the belt tension and alignment can damage the machine or blade.

Replacement parts: 88in long, 3/8 wide blade (for wood).

Use
===

NB: This section covers information that will be covered in an induction, reading it is NOT a substitute for an induction, it is for future reference of both users and inductors.

Safety
------

* Wear safety glasses (PPE cabinet), flying bits of material may hit you in the face!
* Tie up / cover dangling bits of clothing and/or beards - you do not want them caught in the blade!
* Keep fingers away from blade, it is sharp and moving at speed

Basic use
---------

Adjust the blade guard first - to expose only the blade length needed for cutting your work piece.

Items of wood (the blade is for wood only) can be cut into 2 parts by sitting them flat on the base, and guiding them past the blade.

To make straight cuts, use a rip fence clamped to the base and guide the (hopefully square) end of your wood piece along it.
