The vertical bandsaw requires induction. 

The vertical bandsaw is a small bench mounted unit, and useful for cutting wood, plastic and aluminium. The fence is substandard, and requires checking with a square when set.

Do not touch any adjustments other than the fence and blade guide height. Adjusting the belt tension and alignment can damage the machine or blade.
