The Creality CR10-Max 3D printer is a FDM printer taking 1.75mm filament and can print PLA and ABS (TBC)
It has a print bed size of 450mmx450mm with a print hieght of 470mm 

With its enclosure it can print ABS and unlike the other printers in the Swindon Makerspace can be left unattended during long prints. See Absentee printing section below for rules

# SLICER SETTINGS
These changes must be reflected in the slicer to get working prints
The CR10 max uses a 0.6mm nozzle rather than the default 0.4mm nozzle in most software, the default profile on the Lasercutter laptop has been updated but other profiles including on your own laptop need to be changed

# ABSENTEE PRINTING 
At the back of the pritner the is a self triggering fire ball. This will extingwish any potential fire that occurs in the case of a malfunction that causes a fire. The printer itself has many built in safety checks to make sure this never happens but with no one present this is the last line of defence.
When absentee printing please adheare to the following
* Stay for the first hour or 2 to make sure the fire couple of layers stick to the bed correctly with no peeling
* Make sure you have enough filament for the whole print - Octopi does not filament check by default so will just continue printing nothing and you just end up wasting resources
* Check periodically on the 3D printer telegram chat
* Leave the inside LED lighting on so webcam can still see the print


# TELEGRAM CONNECTIVITY
The CR10 printer is connected to the Swindon Makerspace 3D printing channel. This is connected to octoprint to see basic information.
Many of the commands have been disabled to prevent accidental misuse, the only command that works is /status
The status command shows an image of print from the webcam, how far through the print and estimated time of finish
