The Makerspace has a selection of mains and battery powered hand tools. A mostly complete list is included below. While none require induction, if you have never used the tool before it may be best to ask a member to show you how to use it safely. This is most important for the electric planers, circular saws, and angle grinder, which can cause serious personal or material damage if used improperly!

# Cordless drill

Aldi "Workzone" branded. 18V lithium ion battery, charger is a wall-plug labelled "Workzone charger" which plugs into the top of the battery once removed from the drill.

# Mains drill

# 2x electric planers

1x Bosch, 1x "DP Tools". Both take 82mm blades, which can be purchased from ebay or toolstation for around Â£5/pair in case of damage (which does happen from time to time).

# Belt sander

Makita. Belt length TBD. Spare belts live with the sandpaper in the corner next to the metal lathe.

# 2x circular saws

The carbide tipped blades on the saws will cut wood, plastic and thin aluminium (lubricate the cut line using a bead of 3-in-1 oil when cutting aluminium). 

# Jigsaw

Will cut wood, plastic and thin aluminium. Very thin (<2mm) steel is possible to cut, but it's often neater using an angle grinder or sheet metal tools depending on thickness. When cutting aluminium, lubricate the cut line using a bead of 3-in-1 oil.

# Angle Grinder

With cutting and grinding discs. DO NOT USE CUTTING DISCS FOR GRINDING. Cutting discs are thin (<3mm), grinding are >4mm with a large offset from the spindle. Cutting discs are not built for side loads, and can shatter when used for grinding. Gloves and a face mask live above the wood lathe.

# Oscillating sanders/multi tools
