The MIG welder requires induction. Speak to Joe Earlam for induction.

The MIG welder is like a hot glue gun but for metal. It is currently set up for gassless operation, using 0.8mm flux core wire such as [this wire](https://www.toolstation.com/shop/p13760) from Toolstation. Flux core wire is simpler to use than standard wire with gas, but requires more clean-up due to spatter.

Welding masks and gloves live in the corner of the workshop, to the right of the metal lathe. Long sleeves and trousers are highly recommended due to the high UV output of the welding arc, prolonged use with unprotected skin will cause sunburn.
