The MIG welder requires induction. Speak to Joe Earlam for induction.

The MIG welder is like a hot glue gun but for metal. It is currently set up for gassless operation, using 0.8mm flux core wire such as [this wire](https://www.toolstation.com/shop/p13760) from Toolstation. Flux core wire is simpler to use than standard wire with gas, but requires more clean-up due to spatter.

Welding masks and gloves live in the corner of the workshop, to the right of the metal lathe. Long sleeves and trousers are highly recommended due to both sparks and the high UV output of the welding arc, prolonged use with unprotected skin will cause sunburn. Wrap long sleeves around the outside of the gloves so sparks can't fall inside.

# Usage

This does not replace an induction! For induction speak to a member of the metalwork team.

* Clear a space on a workbench. Remove everything flammable from a ~2m radius - rags, solvents etc!
* Turn on the workshop extraction and open the workshop door. Welding produces hazardous smoke which needs to be vented.
* Set up the welding screen between the welding and any other people in the workshop, or the door, depending on who's around.
* If you're using a wooden workbench, put a piece of steel down to protect the surface. There are some large square sheets of 3mm steel in the metal store that have been used for this previously.
* Remove the welder from under the bench. Unwind and untangle the cables for the ground clamp, mains plug and the torch. Plug in the welder.
* Arrange your parts - magnets are stuck to the top of the welder to help with this.
* Attach the ground clamp to either the steel base plate or your part, depending on what is practical.
* Weld your parts. Keep the torch hose as straight as possible during welding, as too tight a radius can cause the wire to stick.
* When finished, re-wind the cables around the handle, replace the magnets, and slide the welder back under the bench.
* Return the welding screen and steel plate to the metal store, and sweep/vacuum the benches and floor.
