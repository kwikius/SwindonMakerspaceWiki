The hackspace uses various services to share hackspace information, news, and media.  While longer project posts on the [main website][Swindon Hackspace] are [appreciated](Contributing), don't let that deter you from sharing smaller amounts of text, pictures, and video.


- [Twitter] and [Facebook]

    Short notices, links, pictures, and videos etc. Ideal during, or in advance of, the weekly hackspace sessions.  Any tweet in which you mention [@snhack] should get the attention of that account, and gain you a retweet should it be of particular interest to all members.  Photos - either direct or via flickr - of a successful (or amusingly \*unsuccessful\*) hackspace project, are a perfect opportunity for a retweet.

    We try not to post multiple re/tweets over a short period, so if you have an awesome but time sensitive link, pic, video, or other bit of news you want to share, please ping us via a separate tweet to let us know. :)

    Facebook acts as a secondary outlet for those members who prefer not to use twitter.

    Examples: hackspace [evenings], [events], [donations], [members], [posts], [printer], [pi], [robots], [toys], [logos], and [alerts].


- [Flickr] and [YouTube]

    Pictures are submitted by members into the [Swindon Hackspace Flickr Group][Flickr], while videos are posted from the [Swindon Hackspace YouTube Account] (either directly, or via member's who have been nominated as "managers").  There's also a playlist on youtube for videos posted by hackspace members, similar to a flickr group, kinda, only not.  If we ever have any educational video content (including presentations by members and visitors), then that will likely be mirrored on vimeo.
