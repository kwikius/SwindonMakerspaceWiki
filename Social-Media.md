The hackspace uses various services to share hackspace information, news, and media.  While longer project posts on the website [are appreciated](Contributing), don't let that deter you from sharing smaller amounts of text, pictures, and video.


- Twitter and Facebook

    Short notices, links, pictures, and videos etc. Ideal during, or in advance of, the weekly hackspace sessions.  Any tweet in which you mention [@snhack] should get the attention of that account, and gain you a retweet should it be of particular interest to all members.  Photos - either direct or via flickr - of a successful (or amusingly \*unsuccessful\*) hackspace project, are a perfect opportunity for a retweet.

    We try not to post multiple re/tweets over a short period, so if you have an awesome but time sensitive link, pic, video, or other bit of news you want to share, please ping us via a separate tweet to let us know. :)

    Facebook acts as a secondary outlet for those members who prefer not to use twitter.
