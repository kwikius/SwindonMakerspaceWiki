## Hackspace expansion/relocation

Much discussion happened around the idea of expansion and its cost, ranging from "do nothing and remain the current knitting-circle group" to "setup a company to manage a space which has allows other groups to use it, or its tools and/or has room for hotdesking". No real decisions were made :(

We should probably figure out what else a new space costs, over and above rent/insurance etc. For example we would need furniture.

## Shopping!

We have, as noted in the Hackspace finances thread, a fair bit of money in the kitty. A list of items was discussed and voted on, see items in the "Immediately Required" list on the [[Shopping List]] page. A few of the more expensive/wilder ones were downvoted, and I've added them to the "Wish List / Suggestions" section.

## Fundraising/events

Oggcamp is in Liverpool this weekend, but only Jamie wanted to go. EMFCamp is next year, several folks seem to want to go.

There was a general feeling that we already have money we're not spending a lot of, and no big/future  plans to spend a lot, so why fundraise a bunch more? Also why do outreach / look for more members if we don't plan on getting a bigger space?

Holding workshops/events for the public - we could ask/hold one at STEAM?

## Membership/attendance/visibility

We're not really trying very hard to advertise, we can likely easily make more noise about our talks, toys and meetings if we try a bit more!

We can easily activate our 3dhubs account and print orders. If we add interesting filaments like Filaflex we'll likely get orders. Mostly it requires someone to pay attention to incoming 3dhubs orders, responding quickly, checking STL files, and then the actual printing. Jamie is ok to do the printing part - and is most useful for that as he has the key. To get paid by 3dhubs for the orders we'll need to create + add a paypal account.

## LogoBot

We should keep on with LogoBot! Invade the Brunel with them (or ask and take them to an event?)

## Conclusions

This meeting seemed to throw up more questions than it answered, we should probably have another one, with a more organised agenda! (says Jess)
