LogoBot is a simple, extensible, Arduino-based mobile robot developed by the Swindon Makerspace.  It is heavily inspired by the vast number of existing mobile robots designs (Mirobot in particular).  The development of the reference design has been kicked-off through the OpenSCAD Course and will be an ongoing collaborative project for all members of the Makerspace to participate in.  

_See the **[LogoBot Documentation]** for detailed instructions on how to build a LogoBot._
