The pillar drill is a small, bench mounted unit. The speed can be changed using the belts under the cover on top (if unsure, ask for help) if required, but is usually set at a reasonably universal speed.

The chuck is keyless. Bed height is changed using the clamp at the back of the bed, and angle can be changed by loosening off the pivot bolt (accessible underneath the bed). Ensure it's tightened up again when finished drilling.

Drill bits are found in the green box next to the drill, or in the box of miscellaneous drills. Any broken drills should be replaced with a matching one from the miscellaneous box, or from Toolstation's cheapest range of HSS drills (less than a pound per drill, smaller sizes sold two per packet).
