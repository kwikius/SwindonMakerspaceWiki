## General Workshop Guidance

The workshop is a potentially dangerous place so wear appropriate clothing, e.g.  sturdy shoes, not open toed sandals. Long hair should be tied back, loose clothing and jewellery should be rolled up or removed.

Make sure you have sufficient room to work in safety and you are comfortable using the hand and power tools you intend to use. Especially ensure you have had an induction on any of the machines that require it. 

Make use of the PPE (Personal Protection Equipment) such as safety glasses and hearing protection. PPE equipment is in the cupboard just outside the workshop door. There is also a first aid kit for minor injuries.

Connect the dust extractor when using any of the major wood working equipment.

In the event of a problem with any of the equipment report it on telegram and if itâ€™s a safety issue clearly mark the machine as do not use.

## Workshop Cleanliness

Put any hand tools, measuring equipment used back in the rack.

Brush down any machines you have used and store appropriately. Sweep workshop floor â€“ doesnâ€™t need to be spotless but clean and tidy â€“ but a good aim is cleaner than you found it ðŸ˜Š

Unplug all machines or at least switch off at the mains socket when finished.

Do NOT use wood dust extractor for metal swarf.

Store/leave large machines as per the individual induction instructions.

Check if dust extractor needs emptying, if so empty into a black bin bag, stocks found under kitchen sink, or workshop bin if room. Take full bags/bins to skip or one of the other bins on Biz Space site. 

## Before Leaving Makerspace

Double check all tools you have used are returned and space is clean and tidy. In the Kitchen wash up and store any cups / cutlery used. Put rubbish in the bin.

Pay for any snacks consumed. 

Power is off in all areas including lights and heaters if used.
