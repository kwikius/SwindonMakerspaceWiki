Most text based documents produced by the Hackspace are stored on Github and collaborated upon using Git.

Documents include program code, web pages, publicity, and other media.  Other (binary) files can be tracked on github - such as images, word documents, and pdf files - but depending upon file type, granular changes to files may not be shown.
