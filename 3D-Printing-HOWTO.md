This page is for collecting knowledge of 3D Printing in general, and how to use the Makerspace' 3D printers, specifically. Info may be mostly provided using a series of links, as the internet is a pretty good resource for this.

## What is 3D printing?

Several resources on the general principle, while reading please note that the Makerspace printers are <span title="Fused Deposition Modelling">FDM</span> style printers.

## Our 3D Printers

The Makerspace currently has 2 working 3D printers:

- [[Prusa MK2 3D Printer]]
- [[Wanhao Prusa i3 Printer]]

## Finding models

To get started in 3D printing, you can look for models that other people have already designed (and tested!) for you. There are a fair number of sites with free downloads, and probably many more with paid model downloads. Try these:

- [Thingiverse](https://thingiverse.com)
- [MyMiniFactory](https://myminifactory.com)
- [Cults3d](https://cults3d.com/en)

## Printing a model

### Summary

- Find (see above), or make (see below), an .stl file of the model you wish to print.
- Slice the model, this creates a .gcode (or .gco) file of the same model, using commands specific to the printer you wish to print on
- Send the file to the printer, use the "Upload" button on Octoprint.
- Load the filament you want, ensure the printer bed is clear and freshly sprayed with hair spray (yes really!)
- Hit the "Print" button on Octoprint
- Watch closely to ensure the first few layers are printed correctly
- Keep an eye on the rest of the print.
- Remove from bed using the scraper.
