Out of the box Inkscape sets it's page for A4. Most people will use Inkscape to design for the [HPC Laser Cutter](HPC-Laser-Cutter). 

To change the default page size so it fits the laser printer (600mm x 400mm) follow these steps:

1) Windows: open windows file explorer (windows key + E), go to the settings folder, enter `%appdata%\inkscape\`.
2) In there create a new folder called: `templates`
