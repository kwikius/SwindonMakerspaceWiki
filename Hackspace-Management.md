# Hackspace Planning

Content related to the management of the Hackspace.  Includes meeting minutes from group planning sessions where applicable.


## Meeting Agendas/Minutes

See [[Meetings]]

## Procedures

These need documenting on a separate [[Procedures]] page!

* We will use GitHub issues to gather tasks and assign them, committed code with a log of "Closes #XX" with the issue number will link it to that issue.
* Issues are also used to indicate todo tasks such as documenting procedures etc.
