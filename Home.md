Welcome to the Wiki for Swindon Hackspace.  Please use this wiki to [[share or record|Contributing]] any information that does not belong on the public website, or in its own github repo.  For longer posts that are of interest to everyone, please consider [[writing a blog post|Contributing]] for the main website.

Note: This page is only linked from the main repo,  
visit [[Swindon Hackspace Wiki]] to see the main home page

To see a list of all wiki pages, see the [Wiki Index](_pages).

Please read the [gollum wiki](https://github.com/gollum/gollum/wiki#bracket-tags) on how to easily link to other pages.

Note that not all of the gollum syntax/features seem to be supported by github's wikis, in particular: title metadata, table of contents, mathematical equations, sequence diagrams, and file includes, to not appear to work (tl;dr: just the link format works then.)
