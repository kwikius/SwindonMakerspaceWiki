# Engraving (flat) glass

These are my results from doing some testing on a bit of 4mm thick, cast glass measuring 100mm x 100mm.

I've included my [testing SVG file](images/HPC-lasercutter/glass-engraving/coaster-template.svg) if want to see it or use it.

During the test I added 2 additional boxes to the test coaster not covered in the template above but I'll explain the settings further on.
