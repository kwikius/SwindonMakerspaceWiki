### Swindon Hackspace Wiki

The [Swindon Hackspace](http://swindon.hackspace.org.uk/) is a place to hack with power tools, with computers, with soldering irons, and with your bare hands – but most importantly, with other people.  The Swindon Hackspace is just getting started, help us become a reality!

Our main website is at [swindon.hackspace.org.uk](http://swindon.hackspace.org.uk), please see our [about page](http://swindon.hackspace.org.uk/about/#weekly-meetings) for meeting times and directions, etc.
