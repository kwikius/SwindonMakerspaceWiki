## Safety 

* Sensible clothing (nothing too loose or with dangly bits inc. hoodie strings), sensible shoes (swarf hurts, basically only closed toe shoes, ones with toe caps if you have them), also safety glasses are required.
* Emergency Stops: Main switch on the headstock, and footbrake (shown in photos)
* Don’t spin anything that is not firmly secured - failing to do so can result in heavy, flying objects, this list includes:
The workpiece - this should be tightly held within the chuck
* 3 and 4 Jaw Chucks:
   - Don’t spin an empty chuck without tightening the jaws.
   - Don’t leave the chuck key in the chuck.

* Collet chuck:
   - Make sure the drawbar is installed and tightened securely.
   - Ensure the grub screw for the spindle cap is tightened.
   - Do not leave the spindle cap installed without the drawbar.
   - Don’t leave the draw bar spanner on the draw bar.

* Similarly, ensure any tools are firmly secured within their holder, the holders within the toolpost, and that the toolpost itself is tightened.
* Keep spindle speed to a sensible speed for your work - going too fast could cause damage to your job, the machine or you!
* If machine seems to not be working correctly, please contact head of the metal working team, Steve Maggs or a Director.
