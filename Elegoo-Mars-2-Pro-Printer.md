The Elegoo Mars 2 Pro printer is a resin printer, sponsored for the Makerspace by Elegoo Marketing Dept.

Resin 3D printing uses a tank (shallow dish) of liquid resin. The build platform starts suspended in the resin, an LCD screen below the tank shades each layer to be printed from a UB light below that. The object is build upside down, with the build plate rising for each successive layer. Once printed, the object is not yet finished, it is still soft and dripping with uncured resin.
