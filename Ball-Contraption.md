## What is it?
An evolving group project to build out a modular Rube Goldberg / GBC style ball-bearing churning machine

## Why?
* Something everyone can contribute to, from very simple to fiendishly complex
* Something new members, or walk-ins, can tinker with
* Modular, extensible - so it can slowly grow over time
* Something we can take to events/shows to get people talking

## Stuff it would be fun to explore
* Different fabrication techniques (old-school woodwork and brass; 3D printed; laser-cut; cardboard and hot-glue)
* Different mechanisms - both mechanical and digital, even fancy control stuff (think magnetic levitation)
* Interactivity - either mechanical (levers) or electronic (wifi, twitter)

## Principles
* Bonkers is good, the crazier the better
* Aesthetics are not important (albeit pretty things are always good)
* Needs to be transportable (in bits)
* Power sources should be kept to a minimum and be shared/standardised (e.g. all modules can work from a common power bus - 12V?)

## Specification
We need a simple, clear specification to allow modules to be interchanged/reconfigured.  The following is heavily inspired by the [GBC standard](http://www.teamhassenplug.org/GBC/):

* Modules are intended to be chained together on one, or more, levels (e.g. on shelves)
* Each module should have one input area/basket and one, or more, output areas - ideally in a direct line or turning a 90 degree corner
* The IN basket should have an opening of at least 64mm x 64mm, 80mm above the supporting surface (table, shelf)
* Most modules will be a single rigid unit, that operates on a single level, moving balls from input to output
* Specialist modules may place input and output areas on different levels (e.g. to raise balls between shelves) - it will help if these modules can accommodate variable shelf spacing!
* Each module should be able to accept balls at an average rate of 1 ball per second.  Balls can be passed continuously, or in a batch.  A batch should not exceed 30 balls.
* Balls should be 16mm (nominal, assume +-1mm tolerance) and either metal or glass (aiming for metal) 

Buying balls - we got our first batch [on ebay](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Catapult-Slingshot-Ammo-Steel-Balls-Choose-Size-From-2mm-to-16mm-FREE-POST-/161126780433?var=460220302041), Â£15 for 100
