## What is it?
An evolving group project to build out a modular Rube Goldberg / GBC style ball-bearing churning machine

## Why?
* Something everyone can contribute to, from very simple to fiendishly complex
* Something new members, or walk-ins, can tinker with
* Modular, extensible - so it can slowly grow over time
* Something we can take to events/shows to get people talking

## Stuff it would be fun to explore
* Different fabrication techniques (old-school woodwork and brass; 3D printed; laser-cut; cardboard and hot-glue)
* Different mechanisms - both mechanical and digital, even fancy control stuff (think magnetic levitation)
* Interactivity - either mechanical (levers) or electronic (wifi, twitter)
  * Dr Nim game
  * Pin-ball table

## Principles
* Bonkers is good, the crazier the better
* Aesthetics are not important (albeit pretty things are always good)
* Needs to be transportable (in bits)
* Power sources should be kept to a minimum and be shared/standardised (i.e. so all modules can work from a common power bus)
* Support for vertical arrangements/stacking (i.e. on shelves) for interest and to help pack more into table-top displays
* Interoperability with other ball-contraption standards would be nice

## Specification

* Modules are intended to be chained together on one or more levels (e.g. on shelves)
* Each module should have two input baskets and one or two output chutes.  
* IN baskets should be on two adjacent sides of a rectangular base, OUT chutes on the remaining sides.  This permits horizontal and vertical arrangements.
* Modules may contain a manual divert mechanism to allow OUTPUTS to be selectively enabled
* The short side of the rectangle should be 200mm, the long side should be a multiple of 200mm.  Thus the entire contraption is laid out on a 200mm grid.  
* Vertical height is not critical, but ideally most modules will be no more than 250mm high to suit 300mm shelf spacing.
* The IN basket should have an opening of at least 60mm x 60mm, 80mm above the supporting surface (table, shelf)
* IN and OUT feeds should be centred on edges of the grid (e.g. 100mm from a grid intersection)
* Most modules will be a single rigid unit, that operates on a single level, moving balls from input to output
* Drop chutes can be used to move balls down through a stack of modules
* Tall lift modules can be used to raise balls up through a stack of modules
* Each module should be able to accept balls at an average rate of 1 ball per second.  Balls can be passed continuously, or in a batch.  A batch should not exceed 30 balls.
* Balls should be 16mm (nominal, assume +-1mm tolerance) and either metal or glass 
* Any modules that rely on metal balls (e.g. magnetism based) should fail gracefully if non magnetic balls (e.g. marbles) are used - i.e. just pass the balls straight to the next module
* Ball weight may vary considerably (e.g. between metal/glass), so modules should be tolerant to weight changes (e.g. by rejecting balls that do not have an appropriate weight)
* Powered modules should accept a regulated 12v input - to allow for a common power bus.  Should we specify a connector type?  terminal blocks?  banana plugs?
